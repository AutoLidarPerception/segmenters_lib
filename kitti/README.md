For downloading all raw data from the KITTI websites, create a new folder, copy this script into the folder and execute it from the command line:

./raw_data_downloader.sh

It will download the zip files and extract them into a coherent data structure: Each folder contains all sequences recorded at a single day, including the calibration files for that day.
